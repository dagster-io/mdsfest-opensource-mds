# Python Rules

This rule applies to all Python files in the project.

## File Pattern
*.py

## Description
When working with Python files, we use `uv` as our package manager and runtime. Python files should be executed using the command `uv run {file}`.

## Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Ruff for code formatting and linting
- Format on save
- Use Ruff's recommended settings:
  - Line length: 88
  - Quote style: double quotes
  - Import sorting: isort style

## Commands
- Run Python file: `uv run {file}`
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Format code: `ruff format {file}`
- Lint code: `ruff check {file}`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check --fix {file}`

## Best Practices
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use Ruff's auto-fix capabilities to maintain code quality
